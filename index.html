       Stress Reduction



       </p>
   </h1>
<p> 
    What I plan on doing during the for the next few weeks while we are on lockdown To Reduce my Stress levels is to rest and sleep as much as I can because breaks like this one don't come very often.
        </p>
<p>
    And since I am going to be home for the next two weeks i am going to have to cook most of my meals myself, so that will be fun and take up some time which will help clear my head of the hectic things around me. .
</p>
      <p>
          Also because I have access gym in my community were I live I can still be active, but even if I didn't have access to a gym I would do excercises at home from Youtube or a Website
        </p>  
     <p>
         I also have access to a pool and a hot tub so I can relax and do something different every once in a while to make me relxed . 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Video Games are also an option that keeps me occupied for at least a couple hours, and makes me forget all the bad things because i'm having fun with my friends online.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Lastly going on walks with my dog is another thing i can do which also clears my mind from everything thast is goin on around the world right now.
