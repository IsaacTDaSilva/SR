    What I plan on doing during the for the next few weeks while we are on lockdown is to rest and sleep as much as I can because breaks like this one don't come very often.
        </p>
<p>
    And since I am going to be home for the next two weeks i am going to have to cook most of my meals myself, so that will be fun and take up some time so that IO am not bored.
</p>
      <p>
          Also because I have a gym in my community were I live I can still be active, but even if I didn't have access to a gym I would do excercises at home from Youtube or a Website
        </p>  
     <p>
         I also have access to a pool and a hot tub so I can relax and do something different every once in a while to take up some time and  keep me occupied. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Video Games are also an option to keep me occupied for at least a couple hours, that is if I don't get bored playing the same games over and over again.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Lastly going on walks with my dog is another thing i can do which also clears my mind from everything thast is goin on around the world right now.
